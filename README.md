# Triangle

![Triangle](Triangle_architects.png)

This sketch is one of the first ones I made with processing. It reminds me a bit of a building and even if the code is very simple
the effect is quite interesting. By clicking you can change the colour of the triangle.

# Vertical Lines

![Vertical Lines](Lines_vertical.png)

This sketch displays an animated pattern of vertical lines. The lines keep changing their colours. When you click new lines appear.
This was one of my first sketches during this class


# Explosion

![Explosion](Random_lines.png)

In this sketch random lines with different colours are drawn from a fixed center. The lines keep getting more and more and each time you open the sketch you get a different animation. 


# Cube

![Cube_code](Cube_colourful.png)

This code is the work of Jan a guy from the class. I added some changes, so when you click the mouse the cube breaks open into
different seperated pieces.
